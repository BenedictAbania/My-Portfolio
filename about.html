                <h4>Hello, <span>Welcome</span> to my HomePage</h4>
                <p>My name is <span>Christian Benedict Abania</span> from <span>1CS-B</span> and in this chapter, you'll get to know a little information about me <br>Starting from my backrgound:</p>
                <p>Currently, I am taking <span>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)</span> at the University of Cabuyao (PNC), Laguna. I take Computer
                    Science as my program because ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to make something <span>extra-ordinary</span>, and for me, all these technologies
                    that we have today is something to be considered extra-ordinary because of the things that it can do for us, and I want to contribute building and
                    improving something like that.</p>
                <p>I'm enthusiastic and reliable person. I'm willing to be a life-long learner for continous development, not only technical but also moraly. I'm also
                    a flexible person, willing to adjust to every changes that will lead for a better outcome. I'm willing to be trained in any way, to be able to
                    fulfill the role that I have to attend. And lastly, I'm a good listener not only technically, but also in personal matters.
                </p>
                <br>
